        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>
          <span>N</span>Chandra Shekhar Azad, born as Chandra Shekhar Tiwari on
          July 23, 1906, was an Indian revolutionary and a prominent figure in
          the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. His
          indomitable spirit, courage, and dedication to the cause of freedom
          made him a legendary figure in Indian history. Azad was born in Bhavra
          village, in present-day Alirajpur district of Madhya Pradesh, India.
          From an early age, he was deeply influenced by the prevailing
          nationalist sentiments and the fervor for independence. He was
          particularly inspired by the sacrifices of revolutionaries like Bhagat
          Singh, Ram Prasad Bismil, and Ashfaqulla Khan. In his youth, Azad
          joined the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920, but
          later he became disillusioned with the Gandhian ideology, feeling that
          more radical action was necessary to achieve independence. He joined
          the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), which later became the
          Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), a revolutionary
          organization dedicated to achieving independence through armed
          struggle. Azad's role in the HSRA was crucial, and he became one of
          its most prominent leaders. He participated in several acts of
          revolutionary violence against British officials and institutions. He
          was involved in the Kakori Conspiracy of 1925, in which members of the
          HSRA looted a train carrying government funds near Kakori, Uttar
          Pradesh, to finance their revolutionary activities. The incident
          brought Azad to the forefront of the independence movement. One of the
          most defining aspects of Azad's persona was his commitment to never
          being captured alive by the British authorities. He took on the name
          "Azad," which means "free" in Urdu, to symbolize his resolve to live
          and die as a free man. He managed to evade capture for several years,
          constantly moving from one place to another, organizing and planning
          revolutionary activities. However, Azad's life was cut short at a
          young age. On February 27, 1931, the police surrounded him in Alfred
          Park (now Azad Park) in Allahabad. Despite being heavily outnumbered,
          Azad refused to surrender and fought bravely. Realizing that he was
          about to be captured, he shot himself with his last bullet, keeping
          his pledge of never being caught alive. He was only 24 years old at
          the time of his death. Chandra Shekhar Azad's martyrdom immortalized
          him as a symbol of courage, defiance, and sacrifice in the struggle
          for Indian independence. His legacy continues to inspire generations
          of Indians to fight against oppression and injustice. Numerous
          memorials, parks, and institutions across India bear his name,
          ensuring that his memory remains eternally engraved in the annals of
          Indian history.
